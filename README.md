# Assignment1
 Groupt assignment for Data Analysis

Due date
23:59, 11 April 2024

Submission files
You are required to submit these following documents, including
1. An one-page report
2. A technical report
3. Source code

One-page report is a document in which discovered statistics and highlighted information
(of your dataset) are visualised to enhance the visual effect, thereby creating attraction and
excitement for audiences, especially non-technical audiences.

Technical report is a document that describes all applied statistical techniques (e.g., cleaning, transformation), plots (e.g., bar plot, dot plot), and tests (e.g., t-test) (on your dataset).
Highlighted discoveries are also discussed to show your understanding of your dataset. Tables
and figures can be included to support textual explanations. The technical report should not
exceed 1000 words.

Source code is a file/set of files that store code scripts for your analysis. Your source code is
required to be non-manipulated, reproducible, clean, and self-explained. Your source code must
be published on GitHub with a brief introduction.
Submission guide.

You are required to upload your one-page report and technical report to the Moodle site. Both
reports must be formatted as .pdf files. The technical report needs to be uploaded to Turnitin
for plagiarism checking. You are allowed to resubmit your technical report (up to 3 times) if
the similarity is higher than 10% before the due date.

Note: AI-based tools, such as ChatGPT, Copilot, etc., are not prohibited. Although you can
use them to assist your work (e.g., cleaning code, grammar check, writing support), you must be
responsible for what you submit. As these tools are large language models for text generation,
they may produce non-sense or duplicated texts. Careful proofreading is highly advised if you
use these tools.

Grading
- The assignment is worth 30% of the total mark of the course.
- The assignment will be marked out of 100.
- The assignment will be evaluated based on your presentation, a one-page report, a technical
report, and the source code. If your code is not reproducible, you may revise and resubmit
it by the end of the following day. Failure to demonstrate reproducible code will result in
a 50% deduction in the source code component of your grade.

Purpose
The aim of this assignment is to conduct a detailed analysis of a provided dataset using both
descriptive and inferential statistics and to produce a comprehensive report summarizing the
key findings. The report should start with an executive summary that outlines the major
insights from the analysis, followed by a detailed description of the dataset, including basic
descriptive statistics. It should also present appropriate graphs to visualize the data and offer
an interpretation of both the data and the graphs. Furthermore, the report should highlight
any unanswered questions or issues encountered during the analysis and assess the accuracy and
functionality of the R code used in generating the statistics and graphs. In conclusion, the report should encapsulate the principal findings and their broader implications. The assignment’s
primary objective is to showcase competency in statistical analysis and data interpretation.
Task description

You need to choose a dataset from Kaggle or data.word for your analysis:
- Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/
- data.word: https://data.world/datasets/open-data

You are required to perform various tasks to indicate your abilities to:
1. Obtain and import the dataset into R.
2. Compute basic descriptive statistics (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation, range, and
quartiles).
3. Clean and process the data (if necessary).
4. Generate appropriate plots (e.g., bar plot, line plot) to visualise the data.
5. Interpret the descriptive statistics and graphs to summarize the main features and patterns
of the data (e.g., trends, variability, outliers, and relationships between variables).
6. Select appropriate inferential statistics to test hypotheses or make predictions about the
population based on the sample data (if possible).
7. Discuss any limitations of your work as well as unresolved questions or problems (i.e.,
technical issues, limitations of the dataset, etc.) that arise from your interpretation. If
you have none, then state this clearly in your report.
8. Prepare all required documents for submission (as described above) to summarize the
main findings and their implications, and identifies any limitations or future directions for
further research.
9. Check the accuracy and functionality of the R code used to produce the statistics and
graphs, and document any errors or bugs encountered.
Note: All graphs for this assignment must be created using R. Please proofread and revise the
report to ensure clarity, coherence, and professionalism in language and formatting.
